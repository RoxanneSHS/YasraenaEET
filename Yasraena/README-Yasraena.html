  <p><a NAME="install"><b>I. INSTALLATION</b>
  <ol>
    <li TYPE="i">To install the Yasraena Mod, first download the zip file. Open the zip file and extract all the files inside, which will be two (the .exe, and the folder containing everything else). Drop all these into your BGII - SoA folder. Then click the .exe and install Yasraena. That's it. TOB is required to play.
  </ol>

  <p>Though this mod is made using the WeiDU standard, and *should* be
  compatible with all other WeiDU-based mods, there is always the possibility
  for conflicts.&nbsp;We suggest you install this mod AFTER the official
  patches, Baldurdash, and TeamBG mods.&nbsp;If you encounter any problems installing the mod, please visit our forums.

  <p><br CLEAR="ALL">
  <b>V. <a NAME="general">GENERAL OVERVIEW</a></b><a NAME="general">  </a>
  <p>Yasraena begins at 9th level, appropriate for a party just leaving Chateau Irenicus. If you do not pick her up then, she can never be picked up. Also, if you ever drop her from the party, she will be gone for good.


	 
  <p><a HREF="#top">Back to top</a>

  <p><a NAME="spoilers"><b>VI. SPOILERS</b></a>
  <p>Yasraena gets on fairly well with all the Bioware NPCs. She has romance conflicts with Aerie, Viconia, and Jaheira. Even if all three Biowares are in the party, you will not see more than one conflict. (Viconia takes precedence.)  It is dangerous to keep Viconia and Yasraena together in ToB.

  <p>Sillara the creator of Yasraena.
  <p>Thanks to XVIII for the wonderful default portrait, and for the other mod portraits! They are beautiful! Thanks also to Plasmocat and Thorium Dragon for the alternates! Thank you, Keryvian, for beta-testing and bug-squashing, in the way that only YOU can!  ^_^  Also, thank you to CamDawg and jcompton for their help with ToB bugs. Thank you to Wistrik for general bug-squashing, helping with the Elhan interjection bugs, and finding many of the places for drow-reactions.
A special thanks to all of Yasraena's fans at CoM--your comments, suggestions, and bug squashing have been very helpful. And your enthusiasm is encouraging. Keltosh, Wistrik, Alexanderrr, Kain, Moongaze, Kai, and Slumlord--you guys rock!
